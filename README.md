Handwritten Digits Recognition _AI Project


Handwritten digit recognition is the capability of computer applications to recognize the human handwritten digits.  It is a hard task for the machine because, peoples have different handwriting styles so handwritten digits are not perfect and can be made with many different shapes and sizes. 

This system is a way to tackle this
problem which uses the image of a digit and recognizes the digit present in the image. A simple Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) model created using PyTorch library over the popular MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits .

Handwritten Digit Recognition is the capability of a computer to fete the mortal handwritten integers from different sources like papers, boards, images and  touch defenses, etc, and classify them into 10 predefined classes (0-9).
In this have numerous challenges, because of different styles of handwritng of different peoples as. Also it is not an Optic character recognition. 

This exploration provides a comprehensive comparison between different machine literacy and deep literacy algorithms for the purpose of handwritten number recognition. 
For this, Vector Machine, Multilayer Perceptron, and Convolutional Neural Network are used. The comparison between these algorithms is carried out on the base of their delicacy and testing- training time supported by plots and maps that have been constructed using matplotlib for visualization.

Datasets Details

The dataset that is being used here is the MNIST digits classification dataset.This dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
The task is to classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9, inclusively.
